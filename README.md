# AlphaOS #
The Alpha Operating System.

# Features #
So far, all this OS does is print the name of the operating system to the screen. It also loads a GDT (Global Descriptor Table). AlphaOS now loads an IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table), we're really moving up in the OSDev world.

# Why? #
I want to have a large project that I can work on when I'm bored.

# PROGRESS #
[x] VGA
[x] GDT
[x] IDT
